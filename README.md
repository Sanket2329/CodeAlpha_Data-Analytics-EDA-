📊 Zomato Bangalore Restaurants — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is completed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship, fulfilling Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as mentioned in the internship instructions.
The analysis explores the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset, focusing on understanding restaurant trends, ratings, cuisines, popularity factors, and cost insights.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform in-depth EDA on a real-world restaurant dataset, uncovering meaningful insights through data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical exploration.

The dataset contains information about:

Restaurant names

Locations

Cuisines

This EDA helps answer important business and consumer behavior questions such as:

Which locations have the most restaurants?

What cuisines are most common?

Do restaurants with online ordering have better ratings?

Does cost influence restaurant ratings?

Which areas show the highest-rated dining experiences?

📝 Task Requirements (from CodeAlpha)
